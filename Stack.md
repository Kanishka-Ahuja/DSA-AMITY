## Definition

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates: the first plate you put on (the top) is the last one you can take off. It's an ordered list where elements are added and removed from the same end, called the "top."

## Basic Operations

* **Push:** Adding a new item to the top of the stack. (Think placing a new plate on top of the stack)
* **Pop:** Removing an item from the top of the stack. (Think taking a plate off the top)

## Basic Terminologies

* **Overflow:** Occurs when no new item can be added as the stack is full. (Imagine trying to add a plate to a full stack - it wouldn't fit!)
* **Underflow:** Happens when no item can be removed as the stack is empty. (Trying to take a plate from an empty stack results in underflow)

## Additional Functionalities

* **Peek():** Retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it. (Like peeking at the top plate without taking it off)
* **isFull():** Checks if the stack is full.
* **isEmpty():** Verifies if the stack is empty.
* **Top pointer:** Indicates the top value of the stack without removing it. (Points to the top plate without taking it)

## Implementations

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, with the choice depending on the specific needs.

## Array Implementation

**Advantages:**

* Offers best performance for random access (directly accessing elements based on index).

**Disadvantages:**

* Limited by a fixed size. (The stack cannot grow larger than the pre-allocated array size)

**Operations:**

* If the array is full, push() returns false.
* If the array is empty, pop() returns null.

## Linked List Implementation

**Advantages:**

* Not limited in size. (The stack can grow as needed)

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires more overhead for managing memory allocation and linking nodes. (Adding and removing elements might be slower compared to arrays)

## Applications of Stacks

Stacks have diverse applications in various fields:

* **Compilers:** Used to manage function calls, variable declarations, and expression evaluation during program translation.
* **Operating Systems:** Used to manage function calls, process scheduling, and memory allocation.
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Used in algorithms like backtracking (e.g., maze solving) and expression evaluation.
* **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Used to implement undo/redo operations in software by storing previous states in a stack.
* **Parsing Data:** Used to break down complex data structures like expressions or sentences into smaller components for processing.
